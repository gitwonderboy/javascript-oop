JavaScript  Object-Oriented Programming

  1. What is Object-Oriented Programming ?
  
          Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.

          Paradim - Is the way we write and organize code in a program

          In Object-Oriented Programming, we represent real-world entities as an object.
    
2. How Object-Oriented Programming works in general ?
3. 
          Making use of existing code.
          
    
3. What are the four pilars of Object-Oriented Programming ?
 
          Inheritance
          * The Mechanism of Creating New Class/Object based on existing Class/Object.
          * Reuse of an existing code without repeating a code.
          
          Encapsulation
          * The process of Hiding Data from outside world.
          * We use private access modifier
          
          Abstraction
          * A way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.
          
          Polymophism
          * Means different forms. In Object-Oriented Programming, we can write methods with same name but different implementation.
          * findSum(a, b){return a+b} findSum(a, b, c){return a+b+c}
